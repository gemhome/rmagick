# RMagick 

RMagick provides Ruby bindings for the popular [ImageMagick][1] image manipulation library. ImageMagick supports a wide variety of file formats including JPEG, PNG, EPS, PDF and SVG. It can be used to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images as well as applying special effects, drawing text, lines, polygons, ellipses and bézier curves.
